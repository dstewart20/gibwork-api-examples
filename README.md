##READ ME
I'm creating an app that demonstrates how to interact with the Gibwork APIs using TypeScript. 
This application will serve as a reference for developers looking to use the Gibwork APIs in their projects.
It will act as a task manager and allow you to create tasks and then explore the tasks you created. 

Reference link for the work I'm going to be doing:
